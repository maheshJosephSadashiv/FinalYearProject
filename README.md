Please make sure you are working on the virtual environment while working on the project. That way we don't need to keep on downloading
any dependecies. 

The virtual environment is in the tello folder and  is named telloenv.

To run the virtual environment make sure you have virtualenv installed 
If not run "pip install virtualenv"

To run the virtual environment :
  run the command :
  ./telloenv/Scripts/Activate
  (make sure you are in the tello dir)
